# rpn

Python commandline script for simple RPN arithmetic.

## Installation

Copy the file `rpn` to somewhere on your system path, and make it executable. (I do this with a link to `~/bin/,rpn` because I like
my additions to the shell to start with a comma, and I like knowing where such things live.)

### Instructions

To start, type

```sh
rpn -h
```

and examine what it prints.  You'll find brief explanations of the optional
arguments, as well as some examples.
